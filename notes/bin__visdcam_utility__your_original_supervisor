Keep your working version (the one you pasted), i.e. with verbs:

start|stop|restart <cam|all>

enable|disable <cam|all>

status [cam|all]

logs <cam|unit> [--follow] [--lines N]

health, pingcam <cam>, lsram [cam|all], clean [cam|all],

killgst, fixperms

getdur <cam>, setdur <cam> <seconds>

info|actions|-h|--help

If you want me to paste that file again verbatim, say the word — but since you were happy with it, I’m leaving it unchanged.
